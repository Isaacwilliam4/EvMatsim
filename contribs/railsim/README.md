# railsim

*railsim* is a QSim-Engine for MATSim, specialized on the simulation of trains. 

Trains behave and interact with links differently than cars: While usually multiple cars can be on one link, 
for safity reasons there should usually be only one train on a track per time. 
And while a car is typically located on one link only, a long train may occupy space on multiple links. 
To capture these differences and offer a realistic simulation of train traffic within MATSim, 
the *railsim* contrib provides a custom QSim-Engine to simulate trains.
