# Train-Specification for railsim

## Introduction

railsim supports the simulation of specific, train-related behavior, e.g. acceleration based on the total weight of a train.
In order to simulate this detailed behavior, additional attributes must be specified per train, i.e. per vehicle type in MATSim.

## Specification

### TransitVehicle Attributes

TODO, e.g. length and acceleration of a train.

#### maxAcceleration

The vehicle-specific acceleration. Unit: meters per square-seconds \[m/s²]

#### maxDeceleration

The vehicle-specific deceleration. Unit: meters per square-seconds \[m/s²]

## Examples
