# Scenario Examples

It is recommended that you do not reference the scenario examples directly when running the optimization script, by default, everything 
in the `scenario_examples` folder is added to git and included in the commit, which, when dealing with large xml files containing a large
number of agents and chargers can lead to quickly maxing out your git repo space. So create a copy of the example and store it outside
of the `scenario_examples` folder, that way it is ignored by git and you don't run into that problem.
